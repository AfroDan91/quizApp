# **Quiz Project**

## **Introduction**
This project is a collaboration between Ewen McVicar (https://github.com/Donkbother) and my self. We set out to make a script that would read questions form a .csv file, present them to the user, collect their input and evaluate their response.
The aim of creating this is to exercise our python coding skills and utilise features we haven't used before.

We hope that this project will demonstrate:
- an ability to work as part of a team
- the ability to peer program effectively 
- show a good understanding of the python coding language
- the ability to work using a feature branch model

## **Design Process**
To begin we had a brief discussion about what type of application we would like to make. We felt that a quiz app would provide us will a manageable coding challenge while still being achievable. We also wanted to utilise a new aspect of python that nether of us had used before. For that we chose accessing and reading .csv files.<br/>
<br/>
Once we had decided what we were going to make we then had to decide how we were going to make it. For this we wrote out in note format a flow of how the features would work. This created a blueprint from which we build the application. As each step was completed we used the blueprint to follow on to the next stage easily.<br/>
<br/>
We used the peer programming method to create the code together, this allowed us to catch bugs easier while writing the code and enabled us to lean on each other for support and assistance.<br/>
<br/>
We tackled creating the app in sprints this allowed us to focus on different aspects of the code at a time and to give us a goal to aim for to help with motivation. At the end of each sprint we reviewed the code we had written and the functionality we had managed to achieve and set a new goal for the next sprit by projecting out progress sofar forward.<br/>
<br/>

# **Sprints**
## **Sprint 1**<br/>
The goal for this sprint was to get the basic functionality working:
- reading the .csv files
- option to choose between multiple categories or general knowledge
- sending questions to user
- receiving response from user
- evaluating response
- feeding back validation
<br/>

### Retrospective
In review of sprint 1 we found that it went very well. In particular the general logic came to us quickly and we had functional code very early on.<br/>
On the flip side we struggled to get the .csv file reading part to work. In future I  will research new concepts and methods more thoroughly before trying to implement them which would have made that part of development smoother. <br/>
Further more we decided that the quiz category selection method should be refactored to make it more user friendly.

## **Sprint 2** <br/>

This was a much shorter sprint with the main outcome being the refactor of the category selection. In all the code change wasn't particularly difficult but it did require changing a lot of the pre-existing codes order.<br/>
The refactor went very well and working code was achieved very soon after development began. The outcome of this refactor was a much more pleasant user experience. As a byproduct of this refactor we also took the time to make the code a little more readable, adding more notes speaking to how the code works.<br/>
<br/>

# **Conclusion**
Overall we are very pleased with how the mini project turned out and we both feel that we successfully flexed our coding, team working and development skills effectively.
